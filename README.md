# JWT-Angular

This folder is an example of how to use Knex. In order to get started, run the bootstrap.sh shell script in your terminal:

$ ./bootstrap.sh
Alternately, you can run the commands individually:

npm install knex, pg
dropdb knex_blog
createdb knex_blog
knex migrate:latest
knex seed:run
Now you should have a database with data!

Run the server with

node server/app.js
